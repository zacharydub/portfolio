      "As Zach’s manager at Freightos I worked closely with him for three years. Zach joined as an associate but quickly became an expert in the field and took on team lead and then management responsibilities. As the business grew Zach took over two critical teams - our freight operations team and our customer success team. Zach’s teams were spread over 4 countries and provided round-the-clock coverage. He was very comfortable with our complicated tech stack and built training that allowed for quick onboarding of new team members. The proof in the pudding is that under Zach’s management we were able to triple our bookings and increase our customer satisfaction to a steady NPS of 60+ and “Excellent” rating on TrustPilot. I am confident that Zach will contribute significantly to any team he joins!",
